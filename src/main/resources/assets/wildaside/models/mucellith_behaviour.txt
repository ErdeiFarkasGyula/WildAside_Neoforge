For Hamza :D

The mucellith is a stationary, hostile, plant-mob
It has 2 'phases':
1.
    It shoots out Sporebombs (already set-up) (animation!)
    When below a certain HP threshold, let's say 20%, it goes into the second phase
2.
    It doesn't attack anymore, but instead becomes resistant to damage and starts regenerating HP (animation!)
    When it regened enough HP(over said threshold), it goes back to its 1. phase

They spawn in the Vibrion Hive either alone or in small groups (2-3)
Its default drop is some Vibrion or Entorium(a small bit rarer), but the most important and rarest being the Mucellith Jaw, used in potion brewing

You can find the model and animation file here, in the models folder
the texture in the textures/entity ofc, where I also added a mucellith_glow.png file, just in case we would like to have something like that

I also haven't imported geckolib into the project, because I am not sure which version to use, etc.

If you need anything or something is not clear, feel free to ping me :D
